                    Testing, Error Handling, And Backend Integration Refinement    


Objective:
           The objective of this project is to develop a dynamic and user-friendly food ordering platform, FoodTruck, that allows customers to browse food items, place orders, track deliveries, and make payments efficiently. The system is built using Next.js for the frontend, Sanity CMS for backend content management, and API integration for shipment and payment processing.


Key Learning Outcomes:
                      Understanding dynamic component development in Next.js

                      Implementing a structured content management system with Sanity CMS

                      Handling API integration for shipment tracking and secure payment processing

                      Refining backend functionalities to improve performance and error handling

                      Ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience



    
                             Error Handling

API Failure Handling:
                      If the shipment or payment API fails, an error message will be displayed, and a retry mechanism will be triggered to ensure a smooth user experience.

Performance Testing:
                      The FoodTruck website undergoes load testing, response time analysis, and API performance evaluation to ensure fast page loads, efficient API calls, and smooth order processing under high traffic conditions.

Security Testing:
                      The FoodTruck website undergoes authentication checks, data encryption, API security testing, and vulnerability assessments to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure secure transactions.

User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
                      The FoodTruck website is tested with real users to ensure that all features, including product browsing, order placement, payment, and shipment tracking, work as expected and meet business requirements before deployment. 

Backend Integration: 
                      The FoodTruck website uses Sanity CMS for managing products and content, while Next.js API routes handle shipment and payment processing, ensuring seamless data flow and efficient backend operations.                                             


Expected Output:     
                      The FoodTruck website should allow users to browse food items, place orders, make secure payments, and track shipments smoothly. Admins should be able to manage products via Sanity CMS, while APIs should handle transactions and deliveries efficiently.
